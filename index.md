Here is Zian Chen.

Currently, I am pursuing the cycle d'ingénieur polytechnicien at the École Polytechnique, with a focus on studying mathematics-related disciplines. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. I successfully completed a three-year program in the China-France Mathematics Talents Class before arriving in France. Then I traveled to France and completed my graduation project titled "G<sub>2</sub>-Structures on 7-Manifolds" online.
