# About Me

## Brief

<img src="/images/again.JPG" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

My name is Chen Zian, which can also be rendered as Chern Tzyyan. I was born in Wenzhou, a medium-sized city in Zhejiang Province, located along the southeastern coast of China. I have also lived in places such as Hangzhou and Hefei. The lifestyle and climate of the picturesque region south of the Yangtze River are something I deeply cherish, yet I consider myself destined to explore the wider world and remain open-minded about future work locations. Currently, I reside in Paris, France, savoring a moveable feast that youth has to offer.

Professionally, my expertise lies in mathematics. I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, with my undergraduate thesis focusing on the study of holonomy group in geometry. These days, I am particularly drawn to the applications of mathematics in theoretical contexts, especially in fields such as stochastic analysis and modeling. Since high school, I have been passionate about understanding the world through the lens of mathematics. Toward this goal, I have delved deeply into physics, gaining significant insights and maintaining a steady interest in physics as a form of personal enrichment. Simultaneously, I am an enthusiastic participant in discussions of the philosophy of science, akin to physicists who seek to expand their perspectives on the same objective reality. Consequently, in my professional pursuits, I am inclined toward research at the intersection of disciplines and real-world problems, rather than purely theoretical inquiries.

In my personal life, I enjoy spending time with friends. Due to geographical and financial constraints, such opportunities are currently limited. Similarly, travel remains a relatively rare indulgence for me. However, I value the human aspect of travel more than the journey itself; with whom I travel matters more than the destination. Life is fleeting, and I am always eager to embrace the possibilities the future holds.
